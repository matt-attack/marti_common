// THIS CLASS IS DEPRECATED.  This class has been replaced with a
// secondary interface to Subscriber that is initialized with the
// address of a boost::shared_ptr<M const> variable.  When a message
// is received, it's value is assigned to this pointer.  This approach
// provides the same simplicity as LatchedSubscriber without confusing
// semantics of faking a pointer type.
// 
// This is an extension of the swri::Subscriber class to simplify the
// common case where you only care about the most recent value of a
// message rather than trying to queue up messages or responding to
// events.  It has its own callback that is provided to
// swri::Subscriber and simply stores the message for the user to
// access whenever necessary.
